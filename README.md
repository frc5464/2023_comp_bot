# 2023_comp_bot

This is the codebase for FRC 5464 Bluejacket Robotics' competition robot for the 2023 season, Charged Up!

Our Bot's name is Danger Zone, which got its name from the code which ensures the bot does not destroy itself!

The code is based on the TimedRobot Java template in WPIlib.
The main methodology used was putting code into one long routine in TimedRobot, then splitting that out into separate classes.

Looking at this season's code, the programming team decided that this is the last year we will use TimedRobot.
5464 has used TimedRobot for years, but it is very limiting when it comes to making good autonomous code.
We will be switching to Command-based programming in the offseason, so we can kick butt with next year's auto!

Code was written by Eva and Gabe this season, with Noah joining in as an intern after Week 1 comp.

54-64!
